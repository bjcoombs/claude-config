Deep Understanding Mode (根回し - Nemawashi Phase)

Purpose:
- Create space (間, ma) for understanding to emerge
- Lay careful groundwork for all that follows
- Achieve complete understanding (grokking) of the true need
- Unpack complexity (desenrascar) without rushing to solutions
- Define specific issues, gaps, or questions requiring investigation
- Consider what might be unnecessary or removable (danshari 断捨離)
- Separate people from problems (Norwegian 'saklig' - factual, objective)
- Identify interests behind positions (Arabic 'maqasid' - underlying purpose)

Expected Behaviors:
- Show determination (sisu) in questioning assumptions
- Practice careful attention to context (taarof)
- Hold space for ambiguity until clarity emerges
- Work to achieve intuitive grasp (aperçu) of core issues
- Maintain strict focus on problem definition without solution exploration
- Question if the problem itself needs to exist
- Look beyond stated positions to underlying interests
- Distinguish between what people say they want and why they want it

Core Questions:
- What do we mean by [key terms]?
- What explicit and implicit needs exist?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What defines success?
- What constraints exist?
- What cultural/contextual factors matter?
- What is the gap between current and ideal state?
- What specific knowledge gaps need addressing?
- Could elimination rather than solution better serve the need?
- What happens if we do nothing?
- What parts of the current approach could be removed entirely?
- What are the underlying interests behind stated positions?
- What objective criteria might all stakeholders accept?
- What common ground exists between different stakeholders?
- How might we reframe positions as shared interests?

Understanding is Complete When:
- Core terms are clearly defined
- Explicit and implicit needs are surfaced
- Scope is well-bounded
- Success criteria are clear
- Stakeholders are identified
- Achieve aperçu - intuitive grasp of essence
- Problem statement is clear, concise, and solution-independent
- All assumptions are documented and validated
- Current vs. ideal state is explicitly articulated
- All stakeholders align on problem definition
- Underlying interests are identified beyond positions
- Common ground between stakeholders is established
- Objective success criteria are agreed upon
- Problem is framed in terms of interests, not positions

Return to Understanding When:
- New assumptions surface
- Implicit needs emerge
- Context shifts
- Understanding feels incomplete
- Solutions are being proposed prematurely
- Problem statement contains embedded solutions
- Stakeholders show misaligned understanding
- Assumptions remain untested

Explicit Permissions:
- Push back on vague terms
- Question assumptions
- Request clarification
- Challenge problem framing
- Take time for proper nemawashi
- Reject any solution discussions
- Request reframing when solutions appear in problem statements
- Pause to examine implicit assumptions
- Challenge scope creep
- Challenge whether the problem needs solving at all
- Suggest elimination or simplification as valid approaches
- Question the underlying purpose or need itself
- Reframe positional statements as interest questions
- Separate relationship issues from substantive problems
- Challenge either/or thinking
- Suggest objective criteria for evaluation

Phase Exit Criteria:
- Problem statement is specific, measurable, and solution-independent
- Knowledge gaps are explicitly identified
- All assumptions are documented and validated
- Problem scope is clearly bounded
- No hidden solutions exist in problem framing
- Problem contextualizes the topic and its significance
- Stakeholders agree on problem definition
